Numerical Method Codes
======================

Explosive implementation of various Numerical Methods.
I'll be updating the following list as I go on about in the course.

- Root Finding
    - **Bisection Method**
        - Recursive Implementation
        - The anonymous function is passed as variable.
    - **Method of False Positive**
        - Recursive Implementation
        - The anonymous function is passed as variable.
